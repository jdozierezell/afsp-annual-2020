<h2>Speaking Out in the Fight to Stop Suicide</h2>
<p>One way we lead the fight to stop suicide is by advocating at the federal, state, and local level to pass suicide prevention policies that can save lives.  That is why we empower volunteer Field Advocates across the country to urge public officials to prioritize suicide prevention and mental health.</p>
<p>Thanks to the hard work of our volunteers and staff, this year we saw the successful passage of five federal bills and 27 state bills in support of our top public policy priorities.</p>

<p>Throughout the year, our volunteer Field Advocates played a key role in the successful passage of important suicide prevention and mental health legislation, including the Law Enforcement Suicide Data Collection Act, the Supporting and Treating Officers in Crisis Act, and the Sustaining Excellence in Medicaid Act.  </p>
<p>Together, we continued to make strides in fighting for: </p>
<p><strong>Increased federal funding for suicide prevention research and programs </strong> This year we successfully advocated for: </p>
<ul class="global_list">
<li>$2 million increase for the Garrett Lee Smith — Suicide Prevention Resource Center, to support suicide prevention work in campus, state, and tribal communities </li>
<li>A new $10 million investment for suicide prevention at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention </li>
<li>Increased funding to the National Institute of Mental Health for suicide prevention research </li>
<li>$7 million increase for the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Prioritization of suicide prevention for Veterans, Servicemembers, and their families</strong>  AFSP supported and saw passage of the Support for Suicide Prevention Coordinators Act, which will require greater oversight of suicide prevention coordinators at the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs. </p>
<p><strong>Designating 9-8-8 as the number for the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline</strong>  AFSP has helped lead the effort to make a 3-digit dialing code for the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline a reality. We provided public comment to the Federal Communications Commission, met with members of Congress, activated our grassroots network, and partnered with other leaders in mental health to move this effort forward.
